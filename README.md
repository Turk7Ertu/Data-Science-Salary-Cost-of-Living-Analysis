# Data-Science-Salary-Cost-of-Living-Analysis
As a data scientist, maximizing salary value is essential. This project analyzes the top 5 locations worldwide where a data scientist's salary (in USD) provides the highest purchasing power based on various cost-of-living indices.
I worked with three different datasets, performing data wrangling on each one before merging them into a single, cohesive dataset after thorough cleaning. Once the data was prepared, I completed the analysis, which included creating visualizations and compiling a presentation to showcase the findings.

The name of the data sets are 
 1) Cost of living
 2) Data Scientist Salaries
 3) Levels Fyi Salary Data
